# Blackjack_simulator
This is a blackjack simulator. You are able to play a game of blackjack against a dealer and bet as if you were in a real casino.

How to run:
Make sure that you have the "blackjack_simulator_log.py", "gui.py" files and the pngs save in the same file. You will want to run the gui.py file.
From here a window will pop up. Enter the amount decks you would like to play with and the corresponding amount of money that you would like to have available, and
click the join button. The game window will open and you call then make the moves that you can make in a normal blackjack game, and you can select how many chips
you want to wager. When you are finished playing, simply close the game window.

We were hoping to incorporate bots into the play, but ran into issues with displaying their hands on the gui.
